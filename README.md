# Content

This repository contains code and data for our working paper:

> Bossek, J., & Grimme, C. On Single-Objective Sub-Graph-Based Mutation for Solving the Bi-Objective Minimum Spanning Tree Problem.

## Note

There is no single file that executes all code in sequence for reproduction.
Files are named in the order they should be executed.
The R-file dependencies.R installs all required R packages either from CRAN or the latest development versions from public GitHub repositories.

## Folders

This repository contains a couple of folders whose content is described briefly in the following:

* *figures/*: additional plots (see next section)
* *instances/*: the benchmark instances (see file ex00_generate_instances.R for the graph generation code)
* *results/*: raw output files in CSV-format; essentially tabular data with one line per experimental run.
* *src/*: R source file shared by multiple experiments.
* *tables/*: LaTeX tables for the tables in the manuscript (generated by ex06b_tables_finegrained.R)


## Supplementary figures

The folder *figues/* contains many more additional plots.

* *figures/apriori_analysis/*: contains heatmaps and graph embeddings supporting the obervations made in Section 4.
* *figures/random_walks/*: contains furhter examples of random walks with different parameter settings (see Section 6.5)
* *figures/benchmark/*: all remaining plots (instances, heat-maps, etc.)
